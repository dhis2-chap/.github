# Welcome to CHAP!

CHAP (Climate Health Analytics Platform) is a collaborative and open platform for harmonizing climate and health data, as well as importing, training, tuning, assessing, and sharing predictive models for climate-informed disease forecasting. It includes streamlined integration with the [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/) system for accessing health data and disseminating forecasts, but is also fully functional as a stand-alone platform. The project started March 2024, supported by a potentially 8-year [Wellcome grant](https://dhis2.org/wellcome-grant-climate-health/).

You can get an overview of CHAP and browse the general information below, or jump straight to our portals with relevant information specifically for [funders](funders), [software/model developers](developers), [country implementers](implementers).

CHAP was initiated and is coordinated by the [HISP](https://www.mn.uio.no/hisp/english/about/index.html) network, but is organised as a collaborative project where we invite contributions by everyone interested in joint development of data processing, machine learning and software to advance the field of climate and health analytics.

## Please join us!
We strive to make all parts of the project development open and transparent, so as to make it as easy as possible to join the CHAP community. Please [send us an email](mailto:chap@dhis2.org) if you are interested, or consult the multitude of open resources connected to the project below.

## CHAP codebase and documentation
Please consult the open-source [CHAP codebase](https://github.com/dhis2/chap-core) and the [CHAP documentation](https://dhis2-chap.github.io/chap-core/) for guidance on how to install and use CHAP. 

## Connecting with DHIS2
To integrate CHAP with the DHIS2 system, we have developed the [DHIS2 Climate App](https://dhis2.org/climate/climate-data-app/) and the [DHIS2 Prediction App](https://github.com/dhis2/prediction-app), as well as a [DevOps guide](DevOps) to CHAP integration with DHIS2. 

## Motivation, strategy and plans
- Please consult the [motivations for CHAP](motivations) to better understand the motivations, ambitions and current features of CHAP.
- For an even broader viewpoint, please consult the description of the [DHIS2 for Climate & Health](https://dhis2.org/climate/) project for strengthening climate-resilient health systems.
- To understand where CHAP is going, please consult (and get involved with) our fully open [development plans](https://github.com/orgs/dhis2-chap/projects/3) for the weeks ahead, our [roadmap ahead](roadmap ahead) or join our [CHAP email list](https://sympa.uio.no/hisp.uio.no/subscribe/chap-updates) for technical announcements, invitations to webinars, and other project updates.
- If you are interested in academic research related to CHAP, we also share openly several more or less developed [manuscript ideas](manuscripts) that we invite you to join.
